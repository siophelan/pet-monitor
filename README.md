# pet-monitor

I developed a monitoring station which, when set up at a specific location, enables households to observe their pets remotely, remain informed about their activity while separated from human caregivers, and use the data and knowledge gained to identify potential wellbeing concerns. 

Deliverables:
(a) Device prototype programmed to run the pet monitoring function
(b) Web interface with hardware and database connectivity
